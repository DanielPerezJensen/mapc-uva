## Server Configuration

In this folder the configuration we used for our tests can be found. We also used a custom one that is listed in tools, this one we edit according to our need using a simple Python script called create_environment.py.

The mapper_config1.json is used for the testing of the exploration algorithms and parameters of the scout agent.
